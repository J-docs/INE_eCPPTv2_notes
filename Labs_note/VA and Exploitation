	|   VULNERABLE:
	|   Authentication bypass in MySQL servers.
	|     State: VULNERABLE (Exploitable)
	|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2012-2122
	|       When a user connects to MariaDB/MySQL, a token (SHA
	|       over a password and a random scramble string) is calculated and compared
	|       with the expected value. Because of incorrect casting, it might've
	|       happened that the token and the expected value were considered equal,
	|       even if the memcmp() returned a non-zero value. In this case
	|       MySQL/MariaDB would think that the password is correct, even while it is
	|       not.  Because the protocol uses random strings, the probability of
	|       hitting this bug is about 1/256.
	|       Which means, if one knows a user name to connect (and "root" almost
	|       always exists), she can connect using *any* password by repeating
	|       connection attempts. ~300 attempts takes only a fraction of second, so
	|       basically account password protection is as good as nonexistent.
